## In this section, examples of Python programs for working with the M4 board will be published.
Work is carried out with the GPIO interface.
Installation instructions for supporting GPIO via wiringpi here - [Wiringpi_M4](https://github.com/Pavelectric/WiringPi_M4)

### Some pictures of the results:
